# uthreads

A minimal **cooperative user-space threading library** written in Rust.

Threads are scheduled round-robin and must voluntarily **yield** control — there is no preemption. Context switching is implemented with POSIX `ucontext` APIs (`getcontext` / `makecontext` / `swapcontext`).

> **Platform:** Linux / macOS only (requires POSIX `ucontext`). Does not compile on Windows.

## Public API

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `thread_create(fn)` | Spawn a new cooperative thread; returns its `ThreadId` |
| `thread_self()` | Return the `ThreadId` of the calling thread |
| `thread_yield()` | Voluntarily hand the CPU to the next ready thread |
| `thread_join(id)` | Block until thread `id` finishes |
| `thread_exit()` | Terminate the calling thread immediately |
| `mutex_new()` | Create a new cooperative mutex; returns a `MutexHandle` |
| `mutex_lock(&handle)` | Acquire the mutex, blocking if another thread holds it |
| `mutex_unlock(&handle)` | Release the mutex and wake the next waiter |

## Using it in your own code

Add this crate as a path dependency in your project's `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
uthreads = { path = "../Thread_Library" }
```

Then use the public API:

```rust
use uthreads::{thread_create, thread_join, thread_yield};

fn main() {
    let t = thread_create(|| {
        println!("Hello from thread {}!", uthreads::thread_self());
        thread_yield();
        println!("Back after yield.");
    });
    thread_join(t);
}
```

## Architecture

```
src/
├── lib.rs        — Public API (thread_create, thread_join, mutex_*, …)
├── scheduler.rs  — Round-robin cooperative scheduler + context switching
├── thread.rs     — Thread Control Block (Tcb) and ThreadState enum
├── context.rs    — Thin wrapper around POSIX ucontext (make/swap context)
└── mutex.rs      — Internal cooperative mutex state (locked, owner, wait queue)

examples/
└── showcase.rs   — Runnable demonstration of every API function
```

## How it works

1. Every thread has a **Thread Control Block** (`Tcb`) holding its saved CPU context, stack, and state.
2. The **scheduler** lives in a `thread_local` and maintains a FIFO ready queue.
3. `thread_yield` / `thread_join` / `mutex_lock` call into the scheduler, which uses `swapcontext` to switch to the next ready thread.
4. Mutexes are cooperative — a blocked thread is marked `Blocked` and removed from the run queue until the current owner calls `mutex_unlock`.

## Web UI Dashboard (WIP)

We are currently building a real-time visualization dashboard to monitor threads and scheduling events.

**Architecture:**
- **Rust Core**: Unmodified, produces standard output logs.
- **Node.js Bridge (`ui-bridge/`)**: Spawns the Rust process, parses its output, and broadcasts state via WebSocket.
- **Next.js Dashboard (`dashboard/`)**: The frontend UI for visualization.

**Phase 2: Node.js Data Bridge**
The `ui-bridge/bridge.js` acts as the middleware. It spawns the Rust binary (`cargo run --example showcase`), captures `stdout`, parses the terminal strings via regex into structured JSON, and broadcasts them over Socket.io on port 3001.

**Phase 3: State Management**
The Next.js app maintains local React state variables (`activeThread`, `readyQueue`, `blockedQueue`, `terminalLogs`) that mirror the internal Rust POSIX ucontext scheduler. It listens to the `os_event` Socket.io channel on `http://localhost:3001`, parsing and reducing incoming structured state updates directly into the UI state in real-time.

**Phase 4: Frontend UI**
The Dashboard now features a highly polished, responsive dark-mode UI powered by Tailwind CSS. Visual segregation separates the **CPU Execution** zone (which glows when active), a horizontal flex-based **Ready Queue**, a highlighted red **Blocked Queue** for threads halted on cooperative mutex execution, and a scrolling live **Terminal Stream** directly mirroring the Rust backend.

**Phase 5: Simulation Mode**
A frontend-only mock data generator was integrated to simulate queue state changes. Because the POSIX backend is fundamentally unsupported natively on Windows, this simulation toggle enables accurate, robust testing of the UI state changes (CPU scheduling, yielding, locking) without relying on the Node bridge.

**Phase 6: Polish & Animation**
Integrated `framer-motion` to provide smooth, kinematic layout animations. As POSIX context switches occur, threads physically glide across the screen between the Active CPU, Ready, and Blocked queues. The underlying simulation state logic was heavily hardened to strictly enforce mutual exclusivity across the queues.

**How to run the UI (Development):**

1. **Start the Node.js Bridge:**
   ```bash
   cd ui-bridge
   node bridge.js
   ```

2. **Start the Next.js Dashboard:**
   ```bash
   cd dashboard
   npm run dev
   ```
